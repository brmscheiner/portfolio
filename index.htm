        <p> I am a developer with professional experience in
          <a id="modeling" class="show_div" href="#/">data modeling</a> and
          <a id="visualization" class="show_div" href="#/">visualization</a>. I spent the beginning of 2016
          at the <a id="rc" class="show_div" href="#/">Recurse Center</a> and worked at the
          <a id="fed" class="show_div" href="#/">Federal Reserve Board</a> from 2013 to 2015.
          At <a id="trinity" class="show_div" href="#/">Trinity University</a>, I double majored in
          math and economics. I have experience with

        <p>
          At school I studied math and econometrics, and further refined
          my analytical abilities while working at the Federal Reserve. I have
          extensive experience with applied econometrics and regression analysis,
          and exposure to many lesser known tools like Bayesian statistics,
          impulse response functions, and stochastic processes. On the data
          pipeline side, a huge part of my job at the Fed involved managing
          the flow of data into our internal databases.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="visualization_container content" style="display:none">
        <p>
          Visualization is my passion. Most of my work at the Fed was about
          bringing data to life to create strong decision-making tools. The
          visualizations I worked on were subject to strict academic standards
          and were used in papers, briefings to the Board of Governors, and Fed
          publications. Since I left the Board, most of my visualizations have been
          art projects, and I have focused on learning tools that will enable me to
          share my work on the web, like P5 and D3.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="python_container content" style="display:none">
        <p>
          Python is definitely my strongest language. Most of the coursework for 
          my computer science minor was in Python, I used it all the time at the 
          Federal Reserve to write data processing scripts, and it was the 
          language I used for my most ambitious projects at the Recurse Center. 
          I am comfortable with many of the more advanced features of the 
          language, such as generators and metaclasses.
        </p>

      <div class="d3_container content" style="display:none">
        <p>
          Ideogram, a project that helps developers take pride in their Python 
          software projects, uses D3 templates to generate visualizations based on 
          source code. In putting this project together, I took advantage of some of 
          D3's built-in layouts to generate force-directed networks and enclosure diagrams, 
          but I also built a custom radial gearing layout. 
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="javascript_container content" style="display:none">
        <p>
          The transition effect used on this site was written in Javascript. 
          Most of my other Javascript experience comes from generating 
          visualizations in libraries like D3 and P5.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="c_container content" style="display:none">
        <p>
          At the Recurse Center I read Kernighan and Ritchie's classic book 
          on C. In addition to becoming familiar with how memory management works, 
          I found it fascinating to learn how bash functions like 'cp' and 'ls' 
          work in practice. I also implemented the Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) compression algorithm.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="matlab_container content" style="display:none">
        <p>
          At the Federal Reserve, I implemented a model of 
          monetary policy contagion in Matlab. In addition, many of the ad hoc 
          charts I worked on were generated in Matlab, including some 
          3D visualizations.

          At the Recurse Center I built zlp, a command line interface for Zulip. 
          As a long time Linux user, I am relatively comfortable writing shell
